Causal Inference - Modeling e-voting and elections in Argentina 

The repository includes a PDF report and correspoding code in R Studio on the causal inference project examining effect of e-voting in Argentina on voters' satisfaction in Argentina, using Statistical Genetic Matching. It was co-created with my classmate as a part of Causal Inference and Statistical Modeling class at Minerva University.
